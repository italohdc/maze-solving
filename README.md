# RoboCup Rescue Maze: A* Search

Emulate a robot in a maze enviroment, finding the best route to move from a point A to a point B. This is possible because of the **A\* Search Algorithm**.

You can see more about the **A\* Search Algorithm** in the book [_Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach_](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) by _Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig_.


## Team

Developed for the **[RoboCup](http://www.robocup.org/) Rescue Maze Competition**.

> Raptor B Team: Italo Lelis de Carvalho, JoÃ£o Pedro Rosada Canesin

> Instructor: Igor Araujo Dias Santos

## Run the code

In order to use a similar language available in the Arduino IDE, this code was
made using the sofware sketchbook Processing.

To compile the code, it's recommended to install **Processing 2.2.1**.
